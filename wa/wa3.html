        On October 23, 2018, 100 Thieves announced that they finished their Series A funding round co-led by Scooter Braun and Drake, who both became co-owners when they raised $25 million. Included in this round was Sequoia Capital, Ludlow Ventures, Courtside Ventures, WndrCo, Marc Benioff, Drew Houston, Green Bay Ventures, Tao Capital and Advancit Capital.[4] Their Series B funding round on July 16, 2019, was led by Artist Capital Management which raised $35 million.

    <h3> <em>League of Legends</em> </h3>
    <p><strong>Inaugural season</strong> </p>

    <p>
    On November 20, 2017, 100 Thieves was accepted as a franchise organization for the 2018 NA LCS season.[9] The team signed Prolly as its head coach and Ssumday, Meteos, Ryu, Cody Sun, and Aphromoo for its starting roster.[10] The team placed first in the spring split regular season with a 12–6 record, securing a bye into the semifinals. Additionally, Aphromoo was voted as MVP of the spring split.[11] The first team they faced in the playoffs was Clutch Gaming, and 100 Thieves won 3–2,[12] moving on to the finals, where they were swept 0–3 by Team Liquid in the finals.[13]

100 Thieves' second-place finish qualified them for Rift Rivals 2018, an international tournament between the top three spring teams from Europe and North America. The team elected to use substitute player Levi in place of Meteos for the tournament.[14] Team Liquid, 100 Thieves, and Echo Fox competed against Europe's Fnatic, G2 Esports, and Splyce, going a combined 4–5 in the double round-robin group stage with 100 Thieves with a 1–2 record after a single win against Splyce. In the best-of-five "relay race" finals, the team lost their game against Fnatic, contributing to North America's combined 1–3 loss to Europe.[15]

Before the summer split, 100 Thieves traded Meteos to Flyquest, in exchange for their jungler, AnDa.[16] Following this roster move, the team placed third in the regular season with a 10–8 record. The team won their first match 3–0 over FlyQuest,[17] before losing 1–3 to Team Liquid in the semi-finals,[18] then losing 2–3 in the third place match to Team SoloMid.[19]

The team's performance across both splits allowed them to qualify for the 2018 League of Legends World Championship in South Korea as North America's second seed.[20] The team was drawn to Group D with Europe's Fnatic, China's Invictus Gaming, and Hong Kong's G-Rex.[21] Shortly after qualifying for the world championship, they replaced Cody Sun with substitute player Rikara.[22] 100 Thieves finished third in their group with a 2–4 record, and 12th overall, not qualifying for the knockout stage.[23]
2019–2022

In 2019, the team extended top laner Ssumday's contract, while Ryu moved to an assistant position.[24][25] Cody Sun and Rikara opted to leave the team, and they were replaced by Huhi and Bang. Partway through the spring split, Huhi was benched in favor or Soligo, but despite attempts at change, the team finished the spring split in dead last, with a 4–14 record, and elected to make additional roster changes for summer. Huhi left the team, and Amazing joined to replace AnDa, who was moved to the academy roster along with Ryu.[26] A month into the split, the team replaced Soligo with Ryu from the academy roster, and also swapped Ssumday with FakeGod, as LCS rules required at least 3 North American residents on the starting roster.[27] The team finished the summer split in eighth place and did not qualify for the post–season.[28]

100 Thieves began the 2020 season with the announcement that PapaSmithy would be joining the team as the new general manager.[29] Zikz was the next addition to the roster, replacing Prolly as head coach,[30] and both Meteos and Cody Sun rejoined the team for the second time,[31] alongside new additions Stunt and Ry0ma. Ryu, Amazing, Bang and Aphromoo all left the team, with FakeGod rejoining Academy and Ssumday rejoining the main roster.[32] In spring, the team finished third in the regular season with a 10–8 record, and qualified for post–season for the first time since 2018.[33] However once in the playoffs,[34] they were swept 0–3 by Cloud9,[35] and then lost 2–3 to Team SoloMid in the losers' bracket.[36] After an 1–5 start in the summer split, the team parted ways with players Meteos and Stunt, and called up academy players Contractz and Poome to replace them.[37] The team finished in seventh at the end of the summer split with a 7–11 record, and were seeded into the loser's bracket of the playoffs, where they would be swept 0–3 by Evil Geniuses to finish their 2020 season.[38]

The 2021 season started with the team signing Closer, FBI, Damonte, and Huhi from Golden Guardians.[39] Ry0ma and Poome were moved to the academy roster,[40] while Cody Sun and Contractz both left the team.[41][42] The team also added Freeze and Lustboy to the coaching staff.[43][44] The season started off with the preseason Lock−In tournament,[45] and the team starting strong, placing first in their group, before sweeping Immortals 2–0 in the first round of the knock−out stage. In the semifinals they faced Cloud9, and despite winning the first two games, were reverse swept to lose 2–3 in the series, and finish 3rd/4th in the tournament.[46] In week 5 of the spring split, the team decided to bring back Ry0ma as their starter and sent Damonte to academy.[47] They finished the spring split in third place, and in the Mid-Season Showdown,[48] were swept 0–3 by Cloud9,[49] before picking up a 3–0 win of their own against Dignitas in the losers bracket.[50] The team faced Team SoloMid next, and fell 1–3, and were eliminated from playoffs.[51]

After a fourth place finish in the spring split, the team parted ways with head coach Zikz and hired Reapered as his replacement.[52] Prior to the start of the summer split, 100 Thieves signed Abbedagge from the LEC, and Ry0ma was subsequently sent back to academy,[53] while Damonte was dropped by the organization.[54] The revamped roster would go on to finish second in the regular season, with a record of 29–16. The team won their first playoff match 3–2 against Evil Geniuses, before falling 2–3 to Team Liquid. In the losers' bracket, 100 Thieves defeated Cloud9 3–1 to set up a finals rematch against Team Liquid. This time around, 100 Thieves defeated Team Liquid in a 3–0 sweep, to win the 2021 LCS Championship[55][56][57] and qualify for the 2021 League of Legends World Championship.[58] The team's performance secured them a bye into Group B alongside China's Edward Gaming, Korea's T1, and Japan's DetonatioN FocusMe.[59] The team finished third in their group, with a 3–3 record, and were eliminated from the tournament, placing 9th–12th overall and ending their season.[60]

In 2022, the team announced all five players would be returning,[61] with top laner Tenacity as a sixth man.[62] Mithy also joined the coaching staff in the off−season.[63] Once again, 100 Thieves were atop their group in the Lock−In tournament,[64] however they were upset 0–2 by Dignitas in the quarterfinals of the Knock−Out stage, and eliminated early.[65][66] Through the first round robin of the spring split, 100 Thieves accumulated a 5–4 record, putting them in a three way tie for third place.[67] 100 Thieves ultimately ended the spring split with a record of 12–6, securing themselves third place. In the first round of Playoffs, they swept Cloud 9 3–0 to advance to the winner bracket finals, where they came back from a 0–2 deficit to reverse sweep Team Liquid and advance to Grand Finals.[68] There, they lost 0–3 to Evil Geniuses, denying 100 Thieves back to back championships.[69]

Following a group stage exit at the 2022 World Championship, General manager PapaSmithy parted ways with the team.[70]

<h3> <em>Valorant</em></h3>
<p>
    On June 4, 2020, 100 Thieves Esports announced their entrance into the Valorant competitive scene through the signing of Hiko. Within three weeks of signing Hiko, the team was finalized.[91] The original team consisted of Valliate, YaBoiDre, Venerated, and Pride. This team, however, did not last long as on August 14, 2020, all members except for Hiko were released.[92][93] On the same day, the team went on the sign CS:GO veteran Nitr0.[94] 3 weeks later, the team brought in another CS:GO veteran in Steel.[95] 2 months later, the team was once again finalized after signing Asuna and Dicey from Immortals.[96] The team went on to win the very first Valorant First Strike tournament defeating TSM in the grand finals.[97]

On January 26, 2021, the team brought in Silenx as a substitute in place of Nitr0 due to Nitr0's wife going into labor.[98] On February 28, 2021, the team benched Dicey in favor of Ethan from CS:GO.[99] After the Masters 3 tourney, the team decided to call up their substitute B0i to the starting roster and moved Steel to the bench. The team also added Seven as a substitute.[100] Their 2021 season ended after falling to Cloud9 in the NA Last Chance Qualifier for Valorant Champions. On November 23, Dicey and B0i were dropped from the team.[101] Soon after, both Steel and Nitr0 departed the team.[102]

They started 2022 with the signing of Ec1s and BabyJ and promoting analyst Jovi to head coach.[103] After two losses in the 2022 NA VCT Challengers Stage 1 group stage, Ec1s and BabyJ were released and the team acquired Bang and JcStani on loans.[104] After being eliminated in the 2022 NA VCT Challengers group stage, the team parted ways with Jovi and hired Sgares as head coach with Mikes joining him as an assistant, and hiring DDK as general manager.[105] On March 27, JcStani announced his free agency after his loan period ended with the team.[106] On April 12, Hiko announced his retirement from competitive Valorant but remained with the organization as a content creator.[107] A couple days after, Bang was fully bought out and the team signed Derrek, Stellar, and Will while Ethan was moved to the bench, and later released.[108] The team was able to qualify for 2022 Valorant Champions after beating The Guard in the grand finals of the NA Last Chance Qualifier.[109] The team was then placed Group D alongside DRX, FURIA Esports, and Fnatic.[110] The team finished the tournament 9-12th.[111] In September and October 2022 respectively, 100 Thieves released Will and signed Cryocells,[112] and Mikes was promoted to head coach after Sgares left the team.[113] 100 Thieves ended the year by winning the Red Bull Home Ground tournament in Manchester with a 3–0 win over Cloud9 in December 2022.[114]

In September 2022, 100 Thieves was selected as one of the thirty teams to be part of Riot Games' partnership program for the 2023 season.[115]
