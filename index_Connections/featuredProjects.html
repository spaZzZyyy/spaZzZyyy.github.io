                Project Blue is a grey box game that was designed to quickly iterate seemless and fluid mechanics for platformer games.
                The code was designed in a way that is modular, so it's quick to change aspects of the game such as world physics and 
                character traits such as speed and jump height. <b>W A D to move Space to dash</b> In continuing to polish the game 
                it is to be noted that tweaking mechanics to correct values and creating playable maps, animations, and sprites are to be added.
                <b>Game was created using the Unity game engine.</b>

          The video showcases gameplay from Risk of Rain 2, however all the sound was muted. Every sound, music, and noise was dubbed in using the <b>Sound software Ableton </b>
          The sound and noises were sync'd up to actions as well as music and sounds were developed in the Ableton software.

          captured and edited in a way to enhance the clip. While Using <b>Adobe premire pro and After effects</b>, it was possible to create
          smooth transitions and add varius effects to the captured clips.
