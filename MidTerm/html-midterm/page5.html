    <h3>Page 2</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>On line 27 there was an unclosed B tag. I closed it.</li>
        <li>On line 53 there was an incorrect order of tags. I fixed it by putting the b tag after the h2 tag.</li>
        <li>Error on line 57, had spaces in href so I fixed it by adding underscores instead of spaces.</li>
    </ol>
